# Instructions
`prob_parse.py` calculates the relative frequencies of the elements themselves and generates a bar chart.
`prob_parse_2.py` calculates the relative frequencies of the various rewrite possibilities for each of the two corpora, and then compares the two files to find the elements which differ the most.
