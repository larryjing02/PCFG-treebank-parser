# Instructions
`prob_parse.py` calculates the relative frequencies of the target symbols themselves and generates a bar chart.  
`prob_parse_2.py` calculates the relative frequencies of the various rewrite possibilities for each of the two corpora, and then compares the two files to find the elements which differ the most.  
For the purposes of CSE/LING472 Assignment 5 Part 1, simply run `python3 prob_parse_2` in the root directory and view the resulting console output.
